Need tor ready mockups then HTML then functionality will be implemented on these:

1) "Upload a translation assets button" mockup is not ready yet.
2) Customer's accounts and setting pages mockups are not yet.
3) View rejection form Mockup on translation view page. 

Queries:
1) Query: In review translation page of an order where will be link of that ?
Suggestion: it can be placed in orders where we have view order button.

2) Query: Translator tab in customer dashbaord will indicate the previous worked translators of that user.

As we know in customer dashboard many things are related to traslator dashboard.
So yet translator dashboard is not started to work so this customer dashboard will reflect dynamically as we will work on translato's dashboard.

3) What is notes in assets detail page section? 

4) Query: Estimated Days on step 3 manageable in which manner ? These should not be static.

5) Query : On Customer Dashboard pages Assets(Glossaries ,style guide,briefs ) should be deleted permanently?
Suggestion:  i think these should be deleted permanently as per mock-up. As there is no restore or activate button in mock-ups.

6) Query:  "Upload a translation assets button" in listing page of all assets(gloosaries,styles and briefs) in customer dashboard pages?
 As we know each asset belongs to a perticular order id. As we have saved in step 3 assets we uploads are based on order id. So here what order id will be saved in this listing page.
Suggestion : It can be latest booked order id of the user?? Mockup is not yet.
