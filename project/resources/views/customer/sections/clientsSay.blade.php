              <p>It’s been a pleasure working with EQHO. The courtesy displayed by the PM’s, the fast response times and on-time deliveries are just a few of the things that make our lives easier. Thanks to the proactive approach of EQHO’s team and ongoing discussions on how processes and workflows could be improved, we are able to meet our demanding goals.</p>
